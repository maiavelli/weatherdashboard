# Weather Dashboard
## Description

A simple weather application to view the current weather in your location, as well as the forecast for the next five days. This app saves your recently searched cities via local storage, to make it easier to search your favorite locations.

- My motivation with this project was to challenge myself to get more familiar with server side APIs and how to use them to retrieve data and make a dynamic application using that data. I incorporated the Open Weather Map API for all of the weather data. I also took this as an opportunity to learn a new CSS framework, called Bulma, which was super fun to work with and made my CSS process much easier! I definitely learned quite a bit with this project and feel very confident in my ability to use server side APIs.

## Usage

Use this application to see the current weather in any city, as well as the 5 day forecast.
